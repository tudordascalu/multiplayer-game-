#How it works

Once you insert a username which is not being used the server is going to try to find you an oponent.

After finding an oponent you will be able to choose between "rock", "paper" and "scissors". The score is displayed on the right corner of the screen and you can also check out other's people score by clicking on the human icon in the upper part of the screen.

#Motivation

This is a personal project with the purpose of better understanding socket.io.
